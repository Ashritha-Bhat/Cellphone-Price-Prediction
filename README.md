Cellphone Price Prediction

Cellphone price prediction involves the prices of mobile phones based on various features and attributes. These features typically include specifications such as brand, model, screen size, camera quality, processor type, RAM, storage capacity, battery life, and possibly others. The dataset is used to train models that can accurately forecast the price of a cellphone given its characteristics. This prediction can be valuable for both consumers and retailers, helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions and assisting retailers in setting competitive pricing strategies.

The task were to classify cellphones into categories based on their price range (e.g., low, medium, high), so it would be a classification problem. However, in most cases, the objective is to predict the exact price of a cellphone, making it a regression problem.

And we had many features for model prediction below some business case analysis .

cell phone price range of mobile phones based on their specifications. Key features include battery power, Bluetooth availability, processor speed, dual SIM support, front and primary camera resolutions, internal memory, mobile dimensions and weight, number of processor cores, pixel resolutions, RAM capacity, screen dimensions, talk time, and connectivity options like 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the price range of a mobile phone using these specifications.

After conducting thorough data analysis and outlier handling techniques, we identified key features such as RAM, Battery Power, Mobile Weight, Screen Size, and Pixel specifications as crucial predictors for mobile price range. Through experimentation, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier emerged as formidable contenders, showcasing impressive performance even without hyperparameter tuning. This underscores their effectiveness in mobile price prediction, highlighting the importance of feature selection and algorithmic robustness in predictive modeling.
